This is a cryptocurrency named Aurum bit made on the concepts of Bitcoin using Blockchain.
It works on the top of flask framework.
Check out the flask documentation for set up: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/
Next we made our chain of blocks on Python:
The components of a block are 
1. Index Number
2.Nonce
3.Data
4.Previous Hash
5.Time stamp
Then we used SHA256 algo for generating our hash. https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html

Flask provided us local hosts. By creating different hosts we ensured, decentralization.
After adding some transactions using json we created Aurum bit
