## Let us connect with b(lock)chain
# This is a cryptocurrency named  Aurum bit made on the concepts of  Bitcoin using Blockchain.
It works on the top of flask framework.<br>
Check out the flask documentation for set up: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/ <br>
Next we made our chain of blocks on Python:<br>
<br><br>

The components of a block are <br>
1.Index Number<br>
2.Nonce<br>
3.Data<br>
4.Previous Hash<br>
5.Time stamp<br>
<br><br>
Then we used SHA256 algo for generating our hash. https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html<br>
After further coding,<br>
We finally hosted it on Postman.<br>
Flask provided us local hosts. By creating different hosts we ensured, decentralization.<br>
After adding some transactions using json we created Aurum bit.<br><br><br>
